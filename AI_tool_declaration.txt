# AI Tool Declaration

I used the following AI tools during the development of this project:

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: To review code, generate scaffolding for modules like visualization and Streamlit integration, and to brainstorm the project structure and deliverables.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained models like `bert-base-uncased` and `gpt2` were used for classification and text generation tasks.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Occasionally suggested completions during repetitive function writing.

All AI-generated content was carefully reviewed, edited, and verified for correctness, performance, and ethical compliance. Final decisions on code structure, design, and commentary were made by me.

This declaration is submitted in compliance with the exam's rules regarding AI tool usage.
